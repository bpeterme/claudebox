# claudebox

A shell utility that runs [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) inside an isolated Docker container, scoped to your current project directory.

Each project gets its own container, named after the directory. Two modes are available: **normal** (full access to your Claude config and SSH keys) and **safe** (sandboxed with dropped capabilities, memory/CPU limits, and an isolated network).

**Machine independent by design.** Conversation history and project memory live in `CBOX_CLAUDE_DIR/projects/` with path names scoped to the container — not the host machine. Point any machine at the same git remote and your full history follows you. Authentication is automatic: credentials are mounted from the host, so no re-authentication is needed inside the container.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (Linux/macOS) or [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/containerization) (macOS)
- `jq`
- `bash` or `zsh`

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bpeterme/claudebox.git ~/claudebox
```

Add to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
source ~/claudebox/cbox.sh
```

Then build the Docker image:

```bash
cbox rebuild
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cd ~/my-project
cbox           # start Claude Code in a container for this project
cbox safe      # same, but sandboxed
cbox shell     # open a zsh shell instead of Claude Code
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cbox` | Start or enter normal container for the current directory |
| `cbox safe` | Start or enter sandboxed container |
| `cbox shell` | Open a zsh shell in the container instead of Claude Code |
| `cbox keepalive` | Run Claude Code; keep container alive for 10 min after exit |
| `cbox stop` | Stop the current project's container |
| `cbox reset` | Remove the current project's container |
| `cbox rebuild` | Rebuild the Docker image |
| `cbox update` | Force-update Claude Code inside a running container |
| `cbox doctor` | Run environment diagnostics |
| `cbox list` | List all cbox containers |
| `cbox gc` | Remove all stopped cbox containers |
| `cbox sync-init <url>` | Initialize cross-machine sync with a git remote |
| `cbox sync` | Pull and push project history manually |

## Cross-Machine Sync

claudebox stores conversation history and project memory in `CBOX_CLAUDE_DIR/projects/`. The folder names are derived from the container workspace path (e.g. `-Workspace-myproject`), which is the same on every machine — making the directory portable without any path translation.

To sync across machines, point `CBOX_CLAUDE_DIR/projects/` at a git remote. claudebox will pull before each session and push after it exits.

### Setup

Create a **private** empty repository on GitHub (or any git host), then run:

```bash
cbox sync-init git@github.com:you/claude-history.git
```

That's it. From this point on, sync is automatic — no extra steps on your other machines beyond running the same command with the same remote URL.

### How it handles conflicts

- Each session commits with a timestamp and hostname, so history is always traceable.
- Push rejections (two machines worked offline) trigger an automatic `git pull --rebase` and retry. Because conversation files are append-only, rebases almost never produce conflicts.
- If a rebase does fail, the local commit is preserved and a clear message tells you exactly what to run to resolve it manually.
- `cbox doctor` shows sync status (remote URL, commits ahead/behind) at a glance.

### What not to use

**Avoid placing `CBOX_CLAUDE_DIR` (default `~/.claude`), or your project directories, on iCloud Drive, Dropbox Smart Sync, Google Drive Stream, or any on-demand cloud storage.** These services evict file contents to stubs when not recently accessed. A container mounting an evicted path will fail to read files that appear to exist on disk — a subtle failure that is hard to diagnose.

**Avoid continuous sync tools (Syncthing, rsync daemons, etc.) for `CBOX_CLAUDE_DIR`.** They can write into the directory while Claude is actively appending to a conversation file, risking corruption or lost writes. The git approach is safe because it only touches the directory at explicit session boundaries.

## Container Modes

### Normal mode (`cbox`)
- Mounts your Claude config and optionally SSH keys and dotfiles
- Intended for trusted development work

### Safe mode (`cbox safe`)
- All Linux capabilities dropped (`--cap-drop=ALL`)
- No privilege escalation (`--security-opt no-new-privileges`)
- 4 GB memory limit, 2 CPU cores, 512 max PIDs
- Isolated network bridge (`cbox-bridge`)
- Claude config mounted read-only

## Configuration

Create `~/.config/claudebox/cbox.env` to override defaults. See [`cbox.env.example`](cbox.env.example) for all options. If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, the file goes in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/claudebox/cbox.env` instead.

> **Migrating from `~/.cbox.env`?** Run: `mkdir -p ~/.config/claudebox && mv ~/.cbox.env ~/.config/claudebox/cbox.env`

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CBOX_IMAGE` | `claudebox` | Docker image name |
| `CBOX_DATA_DIR` | `~/.local/share/cbox` | Per-project container config files (`.claude-<name>.json`), one per project |
| `CBOX_CLAUDE_DIR` | `~/.claude` | Claude Code config, mounted as `~/.claude` (read-write; read-only in safe mode) |
| `CBOX_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.config` | Host config dir, mounted as `~/.config` in container (normal mode, read-write) |
| `CBOX_SHARE_DIR` | `/tmp/cbox-<user>` | Share folder, mounted as `~/share` in container; cleared on exit (read-write) |
| `CBOX_SSH_DIR` | *(unset)* | SSH dir to mount as `~/.ssh` in container (normal mode, **read-only**); unset = no SSH mount |
| `CBOX_ZSHRC` | *(unset)* | `.zshrc` to source as `~/.zshrc.global` inside the container (**read-only**); unset = none |
| `CBOX_BUILD_DIR` | cbox.sh directory | Build context for `cbox rebuild` |
| `BUILD_PLAYWRIGHT` | `0` | Set to `1` to include Playwright + Chromium in the image |

### `~/.config/claudebox/cbox.env` template

```bash
# CBOX_IMAGE="claudebox"
# CBOX_DATA_DIR="${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/cbox"
# CBOX_CLAUDE_DIR="$HOME/.claude"
# CBOX_HOST_CONFIG_DIR="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"
# CBOX_SHARE_DIR="/tmp/cbox-$USER"
# CBOX_SSH_DIR="$HOME/.ssh"    # unset = no SSH mount
# CBOX_ZSHRC="$HOME/.zshrc"   # unset = none
# CBOX_BUILD_DIR="$HOME/claudebox"
# BUILD_PLAYWRIGHT=0
```

## Container Image

The image is based on Ubuntu 24.04 and includes:

- Node.js 22, Claude Code
- Python 3, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- Git, git-crypt, openssh-client
- ripgrep, fd-find, jq, eza
- zsh with autosuggestions and syntax highlighting
- Playwright + Chromium (opt-in via `BUILD_PLAYWRIGHT=1`)

The container user is `claude` (UID matches your host UID to avoid permission issues on mounted volumes).

## macOS: Screenshot Script

[`macos/screenshot.sh`](macos/screenshot.sh) captures an interactive screenshot (drag to select a region, same as ⇧⌘4) and saves it directly to the container's `~/share/` folder. It reads `~/.config/claudebox/cbox.env` automatically so no path configuration is needed. See [`macos/README.md`](macos/README.md) for how to assign a keyboard shortcut via Automator, Hammerspoon, or Raycast.

## How It Works

- Container name is derived from the current directory name (e.g. `my-project`)
- Project directory is mounted at `/Workspace/<name>` inside the container
- Claude Code is updated automatically once per day on first use
- On exit, the container is stopped and the share folder is cleared
- `cbox keepalive` leaves the container running for 10 minutes (useful for follow-up `exec` calls)
- Authentication is automatic — credentials are mounted from the host, so no re-authentication is needed inside the container

## Works With

### [flux](https://github.com/bpeterme/flux)

[flux](https://github.com/bpeterme/flux) handles automatic file routing between any Git remote and large file cloud object storage. If your projects involve large assets alongside code, claudebox and flux complement each other naturally — claudebox scopes Claude Code to your project, flux manages the file transport layer for assets that don't belong in a regular git repo.
